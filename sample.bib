  abstract         = {The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association is the style manual of choice for writers, editors, students, and educators in the social and behavioral sciences. It provides invaluable guidance on all aspects of the writing process, from the ethics of authorship to the word choice that best reduces bias in language. Well-known for its authoritative and easy-to-use reference and citation system, the Publication Manual also offers guidance on choosing the headings, tables. figures, and tone that will result in strong, simple, and elegant scientific communication. The sixth edition has been revised and updated to include: new ethics guidance on such topics as determining authorship and terms of collaboration, duplicate publication, plagiarism and self-plagiarism, disguising of participants, and making data available to others for verification; new journal article reporting standards to help readers report empirical research with clarity and precision; simplified {APA} heading style to make it more conducive to electronic publication; updated guidelines for reducing bias in language, including a new section on presenting historical language that is inappropriate by present standards; new guidelines for reporting inferential statistics; new instruction on using supplemental files containing lengthy data set sand other media; significantly expanded content on choosing the best way to display results, including electrophysiological and biological data; consolidated information on all aspects of reference citations, with an expanded discussion of electronic sources emphasizing the role of the digital object identifier as a reliable way to locale information, and, new guidance on the publication process including the function and process of peer review; a discussion of ethical, legal, and policy requirements in publication; and guidelines on working with the publisher while the article is in press.
