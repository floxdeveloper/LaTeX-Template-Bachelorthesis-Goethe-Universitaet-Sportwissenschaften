# LaTeX-Template-Bachelorthesis-Goethe-Universitaet-Sportwissenschaften
This is an unofficial LaTeX template for a bachelor thesis at the Institut für Sportwissenschaften Fachbereich 05 of the Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main, based on the official [Word-template](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/59171713/Dokumentvorlage_Thesis_Seminararbeit.doc) offered by the institute.

It is only a rebuild and is neither officially supported nor checked by the institute!

## Build
In order to build a PDF, I recommend the following:
1. Check out the repository or download it as a zip and extract it to your computer.
2. Open document.tex in a TeX editor of your choice. Recommendation: [TeXStudio](https://texstudio.org/)
3. Familiarise yourself with the structure.
4. Open the included .tex files from the content/ and ads/ folders with CTRL + a click on the included filenames.
5. Execute the `Create & Display` command.
